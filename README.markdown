This small python module exports a single funtion, `parse()`, that parses a
string containing
[ASCIIMathML](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html) and
returns the corresponding MathML tree as an
[xml.etree.ElementTree](http://docs.python.org/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)
instance.

Also included is a
[python-markdown](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)
extension that translates text enclosed between '$$' into MathML.

## Example usage

## Dependencies and installation

## Browsers support

As far as I know only firefox, among the major browsers, supports MathML.
